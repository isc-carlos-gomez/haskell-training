Types and Functions
===================

Types are needed to prevent runtime mistakes, a runtime error is much more expensive than a compile-time error.

Types help composition because one arrow can follow another only if their respective end and initial types match. Although typing might be optional, they make for good documentation and for those who don't value such documentation there's always *type inference*.


What are Types?
---------------
Types are sets of values, and there are finite and infinite sets of values, like Boolean and Integer; when we declare a type in a programming language we're annotating a variable to ensure that it contains only values belonging to an specific set.

For example, a boolean variable can contain only one of two (finite) options, either **true** or **false**; by contrast an integer variable could contain an infinite number of values, from **-&infin;** to **+&infin;**.


Set Theory
----------
It's important to highlight that the main purpose of Category Theory is to abstract and generalize objects in such a way that they can be analyzed through their relationships and their details become irrelevant. This way objects from different branches of Mathematics can be studied together or using a common pattern.

But no generalization is possible without the study of the details and in this case **Set Theory** seems to be the must recurrent source of examples when explaining where Category Theory generalizations come from.

Some times it even seems like **Set Theory** is the foundation of Category Theory, but that is more an assumption than a fact. What is certain is that along the book **Set Theory** is used to introduce Category Theory, which is then used to explain Haskell's approach to functional programming.


Set and Hask
------------
We've seen that mathematical functions make for a great representation of programming functions and sets are really convenient to describe types; we also know that composition is at the core of programming and Category Theory is a composition framework, all these pieces should glue together to define a programming model.

Well, it turns out that there's a [category of Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_sets), called Set, where objects are sets and morphisms are mathematical functions; given these and other features, like composability, products, co-products and the like; Set is ideal to model programming, but there are some inconveniences:

  - Programming functions are computations, not mathematical functions
  - Programming needs the notion of a never ending computation, which should be a valid member of every type

To overcome these inconveniences a pseudo-category called [Hask](https://wiki.haskell.org/Hask) was invented to extend Set and model the **Haskell** language. Hask can't be considered a category because to model never ending computations every set is given an extra element called bottom (`_|_`), which is very convenient for programming, but breaks the rules of composition.

So, in Set a function mapping to boolean has only `true` and `false` as possible values; but in Hask that same function has `true`, `false` and `_|_` as possible values. For example the following function returning `undefined`, which evaluates to bottom, is totally valid in Haskell:

```haskell
f :: Int -> Bool
f x = undefined
```


Pure Functions
--------------
For the category model to work functions must be pure mappings with no side effects. In other words, functions must produce the same result given the same input and the context where the function is executed must not suffer any changes.


Examples of Types
-----------------

### Void
Void is the representation of the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set). As an empty set has no elements mapping something from void results absurd or impossible:

```haskell
absurd :: Void -> a
```

### Unit
Unit is the representation of the singleton set, a set with a single element. In other languages this value is represented by the `void` type, but in Haskell it's represented by `()` and everything can be mapped from this set and this set can be mapped to anything:

```haskell
five :: () -> a
five () = 5
-- Invoked as:
five()

unit :: a -> ()
unit _ = ()
```

### Bool
Bool is a set with two elements, either true or false:

```haskell
data Bool = True | False
```
