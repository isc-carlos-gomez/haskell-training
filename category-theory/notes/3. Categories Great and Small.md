Categories Great and Small
==========================

Categories are diverse, they can be really small or too big; for instance there's an empty category with no objects at all and there is a category of categories call *Cat*.

Another thing to consider is that any directed graph can be extended to compose a category by adding the proper arrows to implement identity and composition.


hom-set
-------
A *hom-set* is the set of morphisms from object `a` to object `b` in a category `C` and is written as `C(a, b)`.


Orders
------
Categories that express a notion of order by using the binary relation *less than or equal (`≤`)* as morphisms between objects. These categories are considered thin as there is at most one morphism between two given objects.

### Preorder
An order category where there is at most one morphism going from any object `a` to any object `b`.

Properties:
- hom-sets are either empty sets or singletons
- Reflexivity: `a ≤ a`
- Transitivity: `a ≤ b ≤ c → a ≤ c`

### Partial order
A preorder with no circular relationships between any two objects.

Properties:
- hom-sets are either empty sets or singletons
- Reflexivity, transitivity and
- Antisymmetry: `a ≤ b ≤ a → a = b`

### Total order
A partial order where any two objects are in a relation with each other, one way or another.

Properties:
- hom-sets are singletons
- Reflexivity, transitivity, antisymmetry and
- Connexity: either `a ≤ b` or `b ≤ a`, but they're always connected

Monoids
-------
A *monoid* is an algebraic structure consisting of a single set together with an associative binary operation that has identity. Addition and multiplication of natural numbers (`N`) are canonical examples of monoids:

| Single Set | Associativity             | Identity     |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| N + N = N  | (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) | 0: a + 0 = a |
| N * N = N  | (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) | 1: a * 1 = a |

Considering that an associative binary operation is composable by nature and translating the single set of a monoid into a single object, we get a category with a single object and a set of morphisms that compose indefinitely.

Monoids are a perfect expression of perpetual composition, for instance, one could keep adding natural numbers forever and would still have a natural number as a result. Also, this structure is perfect to abstract the details of input values, one couldn't tell whether the inputs are primitive values or the result of many additions.

### Monoids in Haskell
Monoids are defined in Haskell as a base class implemented and extended by other types and classes, and, to say so, has only two methods; although the [actual definition](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monoid#The_basics) is slightly different:
```haskell
class Monoid m where
    -- Monoid empty, or identity
    mempty :: m

    -- Monoid append, the associative binary operation
    mappend :: m -> m -> m
```

Example of a data type implementing Monoid:

```haskell
instance Monoid List where
    -- Identity is given by the empty list
    mempty = []

    -- Concatenation is the associative binary operation
    mappend = (++)
```

### Point-free notation
Point-free notation is commonly used in Haskell to express that a function is declared as a equality of functions and the parameters are not specified. It's called point-free because in Math the input values of a function are considered points on a graph, so a function is commonly declared along with its points (arguments) and skipping the declaration of its points gives us a point-free notation.
