Category: The Essence of Composition
====================================

Category Theory is a singular branch of Mathematics that studies objects abstracting all their details, focusing only on the structures that they compose through their relationships.


Category
--------
Considering that relationships can be depicted as arrows, a category can be defined as a collection of objects connected by arrows and those arrows compose.


Objects
-------
An object is an abstract representation of anything that has a relationship with itself.

Objects are never looked inside, they remain abstract and only reveal their relationships with themselves and other objects. For this reason some people think that objects don't really exist in categories and relationships are enough to define them.


Arrows
------
Arrows are connections between objects. In programming we call them functions, but they are also known as morphisms, mappings and transformations.

Example of a function `f` defined in Haskell:

    f :: A -> B

Graphical representation:

Composition
-----------
Arrows must compose, in other words, for every two arrows connected one after another there is always a third arrow that goes from the beginning of the first arrow to the end of the second arrow:

![Composition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/110193599-d005af80-7e02-11eb-8c95-7f8a97dfb108.png)

In the previous image every arrow has a name, if they were Haskell functions and we would explore their types, they would look something like this:

    f :: A -> B
    g :: B -> C
    g . f :: A -> C

`g . f` is read *g after f* and is the composition of the functions `f` and `g`. Notice how similar 
is Haskell to Math, they both use the same notation for composition!

### Associativity
In a category with three arrows connected one after another will also exist arrows for the 
composition of those three arrows:

Then the resulting graph can be navigated from `A` to `D` in any of the following ways:

    A -> B -> C -> D
    A -> B -> D
    A -> C -> D

Which is the same as composing the following arrows:

    h . g . f
    (h . g) . f
    h . (g . f)

In any of these cases the result is the same, we start in `A` and end in `D`, which means that 
composition is associative and it doesn't matter in which orde we compose arrows.

### Identity
Every object has an arrow to itself that is considered the unit of composition and has no impact 
when composed with another arrow:

![Identity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/110193601-d005af80-7e02-11eb-8c94-24b56d64a177.png)

In the image, starting on `A`, we can follow `id` and then `f`, or `f` and then `id` and we always arrive to the same place, which is `B`. This demonstrates how composing an identity arrow with any other arrow has no impact on the result.

In Haskell the identity function has a single definition that supports all data types:

    id :: a -> a
    id x = x

Then for a function `f :: A -> B`, the following is always true:

    f . id = f
    id . f = f


Relevance for Programming
-------------------------
As Bartosz explains in his teachings, one fundamental activity we programmers do is **decomposing** big problems into smaller ones that can be solved with simpler solutions and then **compose** back those simpler solutions to end up solving the big problem.

We could say composition is at the core of Programming and Category Theory is a framework to implement composition in an organized and consistent way, which may be paramount to programmers.
