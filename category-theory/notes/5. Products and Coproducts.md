Products and Coproducts
=======================

Isomorphism
-----------
An invertible morphism; or a pair of morphisms, one being the inverse of the other.

    f . g = id
    g . f = id


Universal Construction
----------------------
A process used within a category to define objects with certain properties in terms of their morphisms:

1. Identify the property that defines the target object (aka *universal property*).
1. Find the pattern of objects and morphisms demonstrating that property.
1. Look for all the occurrences of the pattern within a category.
1. Stablish a ranking to order the found occurrences. This means that, like in any *preorder*, there will be unique morphisms going from the objects lower in the rank to the ones higher in the rank.
1. Pick the best object. The best object is expected to be unique, but in this case all we expect is for the object ot be *unique up to unique isomorphism*, which means that other *best* objects may exist as far as all them have one and only one isomorphism among them.

Universal constructions are equivalent to the mathematical constructions used by mathematicians to define objects out of axioms (assumptions).


Initial Object
--------------
Universal construction created out of an empty set.

> The initial object is the object that has one and only one morphism going to any object in the category.

![Initial Object](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/117909225-d6535480-b2a7-11eb-80eb-93ad46603d89.png)

In the Hask category the initial object is called `Void`, which in Haskell is a data type with no elements.


Terminal Object
---------------
Universal construction created out of singleton set.

> The terminal object is the object with one and only one morphism coming to it from any object in the category.

![Terminal Object](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/117909224-d6535480-b2a7-11eb-89f9-df8d216c7856.png)

In the Hask category the terminal object is called `Unit` and is represented as an empty tuple in Haskell: `()`.


Product
-------
Universal construction created out of the cartesian product of two sets.

> A product of two objects `A` and `B` is the object `C` equipped with two projections such that for any other object `C′` equipped with two projections there is a unique morphism `m` from `C′` to `C` that factorizes those projections.

![Product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/117909220-d5babe00-b2a7-11eb-8a61-26cfd7ec3a7e.png)

In the Hask category the product is a pair `(a, b)`. In Haskell products can be created either by using tuples or the record syntax:

```haskell
point :: (Int, Int)
point = (1, 2)
fst point
-- 1
snd point
-- 2

data Point = Point { x :: Int
                   , y :: Int
                   }
point :: Point
point = Point 1 2
x point
-- 1
y point
-- 2
```


Coproduct
---------
Universal construction created out of the [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union) of two sets. In a disjoint union all the elements are tagged in such a way that the original sets can always be identified.

> A coproduct of two objects `A` and `B` is the object `C` equipped with two injections such that for any other object `C′` equipped with two injections there is a unique morphism `m` from `C` to `C′` that factorizes those injections.

![Coproduct](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/117909221-d6535480-b2a7-11eb-8d3d-fcd0c0b5931f.png)

In the Hask category the coproduct is a union type `a | b`. In Haskell coproducts are implemented as union types and `Either` is its canonical representation:

```haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b
```


Duality
-------
An opposite category can be created out of any category just by reversing the direction of all its morphisms. The initial object of the category **_C_** is the terminal object in the opposite category **_C<sup>op</sup>_** and vice versa.

In some cases, like in product and coproduct, the prefix *co* is used to name constructions from opposite categories.


Asymmetry
---------
Products and coproducts (and initial and terminal objects) are duals of each other, but they are not symmetric, one cannot make the same assumptions for both constructions. This asymmetry is due to the functions being used as morphisms, there are several types of functions and not all them allow direct mappings between domains and codomains:

Challenges
----------
#### 1. Show that the terminal object is unique up to unique isomorphism.
By definition the terminal object has one and only one morphism coming to it from all the other objects. If a category had two terminal objects, `t1` and `t2`, they would be isomorphic because, given the definition of terminal object, there would be morphism `t2 -> t1` and `t1 -> t2` which would compose and their composition would be equal to identity; and given that any incoming morphism in a terminal object is unique, then such isomorphism would be unique.


#### 2. What is a product of two objects in a poset?
The product is the most immediate parent of those two objects:

![Poset Product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/117909222-d6535480-b2a7-11eb-9087-559592dac04d.png)


#### 3. What is a coproduct of two objects in a poset?
The coproduct is the most immediate child of those two objects:

![Poset Coproduct](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7043153/117909219-d5babe00-b2a7-11eb-9f08-f85586ac63c5.png)


#### 4. Implement the equivalent of Haskell `Either` as a generic type in your favorite language (other than Haskell).
See [Either.java](../java/src/test/java/org/krloxz/training/cattheory/coproduct/Either.java)


#### 5. Show that `Either` is a “better” coproduct than `int` equipped with two injections:
```c++
int i (int n) { return n; }
int j (bool b) { return b ? 0 : 1; }
```

Hint - define a function that factorizes i and j:
```c++
int m (Either const & e);
```

See [EitherCoproductTests.java](../java/src/test/java/org/krloxz/training/cattheory/coproduct/EitherCoproductTests.java)


#### 6. Continuing the previous problem: How would you argue that `int` with the two injections `i` and `j` cannot be “better” than `Either`?
In this case `int` cannot be better than `Either` because the codomains of the injections overlap on `0` and `1` and it makes impossible to map `int` back into `bool`; so the factorizer function between `int` and `Either`, for `i` and `j`, doesn't exist.


#### 7. Still continuing: What about these injections?
```c++
int i (int n) {
  if (n < 0) return n;
  return n + 2;
}
int j (bool b) { return b ? 0 : 1; }
```
In this case `int` cannot be better than `Either` because `i` is non-injective and there are instances (i.e. when `n` is `int` max or min) where it's impossible to map back the original `int`; so the factorizer function between `int` and `Either`, for `i` and `j`, doesn't exist.

See [EitherCoproductTests.java](../java/src/test/java/org/krloxz/training/cattheory/coproduct/EitherCoproductTests.java) for more details.


#### 8. Come up with an inferior candidate for a coproduct of `int` and `bool` that cannot be better than `Either` because it allows multiple acceptable morphisms from it to `Either` .
